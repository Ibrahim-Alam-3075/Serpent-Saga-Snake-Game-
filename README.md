# Serpent Saga Game Repository

Welcome to the Serpent Saga Game repository! This project brings to life a classic snake game implemented in C++ using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to provide an engaging and entertaining gaming experience.

## Overview

Serpent Saga offers a familiar yet exciting gameplay experience. Maneuver the snake through a grid, consuming fruits to grow longer while avoiding collisions with its own body and strategically placed bombs. The game introduces an extra layer of challenge with the appearance of bombs, requiring players to make quick decisions to navigate the snake and maintain a high score.

## Features

### Intuitive Controls

Navigate the snake's direction with arrow keys, providing a straightforward and responsive control mechanism. The simplicity of controls allows players to focus on the game's strategic elements.

### Dynamic Gameplay

As you progress through the game, the snake's length increases with each fruit consumed. The appearance of bombs adds an element of risk, forcing players to balance score accumulation with avoiding potential collisions.

### Score Tracking

Track your progress with a real-time display of your current score. The game also records the highest score achieved, providing a competitive element for players to strive for improvement.

### Pause and Restart Options

Pause the game at any time using the 'P' key, allowing players to take a break or strategize their next moves. The 'R' key restarts the game, providing a quick reset for those eager to try again.
